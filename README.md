## Key Features
- Creating To-Do Lists: Users can create multiple to-do lists based on their preferences or categories. Each list has a unique name and can contain multiple tasks.
Adding New Items: Users can easily add new tasks to their to-do lists. The application provides an input field where users can enter the task details and submit them to be added to the list.
- Deleting Tasks: Once a task is completed or no longer relevant, users have the option to delete it from their to-do list. This helps keep the list organized and clutter-free.
- Custom Lists: In addition to the default to-do list, users can create custom lists to cater to specific projects, events, or categories. This allows for better organization and management of tasks.
- Database Persistence: The project utilizes MongoDB as the database to store the to-do lists and tasks. Using Mongoose as the object modeling tool and Express for server-side routing, the application ensures data persistence and efficient retrieval of information.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store the to-do lists and tasks.
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js, used for server-side routing and handling API requests.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing a straightforward way to interact with the database.
- Body-parser: A middleware module for handling HTTP request bodies in Express.js.
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A templating engine that allows dynamic rendering of HTML files with JavaScript.

## Future Enhancements
Although the current version of my MongoDB To-Do List project provides the essential functionality, there are several potential improvements and features that can be added in the future, such as:
- User Authentication: Implementing user authentication and user-specific to-do lists for enhanced privacy and personalization.
- Task Prioritization: Adding the ability to set task priorities or deadlines, allowing users to manage their tasks more efficiently.
- Task Sorting and Filtering: Providing options to sort or filter tasks based on various criteria, such as due date, priority, or completion status.
- Collaborative Lists: Enabling users to share their to-do lists with others, facilitating collaboration and task management in teams or groups.
- Notifications and Reminders: Adding reminders or notifications for upcoming tasks or approaching deadlines to help users stay organized and on track.
- Mobile Responsiveness: Enhancing the project's design and layout to ensure optimal user experience across different devices, including smartphones and tablets.
